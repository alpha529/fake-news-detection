Code Implementation – Model 3 – CNN
• Used an online article for CNN code reference using Keras
• i have considered the reference model but not taken the exact code 
• Reference : https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/

Installations required for Code Execution
• I have worked on jupyter notebooks and installed required content in anaconda.
• Install xgboost on anaconda using
• Command: conda install -c conda-forge xgboost
• Install Keras on anaconda using
• Command: conda install -c conda-forge keras
• The above command underneath download TensorFlow

For running CNN Model
• Download Model.h5.
• The training of the model is saved with parameters and the model is saved in model.h5
file.
